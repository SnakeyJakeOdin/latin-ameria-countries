    <h1>What is Latin America</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latin America</a> are regions of North and South America that were once part of the Spanish, French, or Portuguese empires. Although the Spanish empire did once rule over parts of the current USA and Canada landmass, these two countries are not considered to be part of Latin America for reasons that are currently unknown to me.</p>
