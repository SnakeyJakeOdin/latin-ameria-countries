    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Mexico has some of the best food in the entire world (in my humble opinion). While known for having spicy food, mexican cuisine also incorporates a variety of fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, avocadoes, chili peppers, and beans to give the food a colorful presentation with ingredients only found in the region. Some well known foods include tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tamales, quesadillas, menudo, and much more.</p>
